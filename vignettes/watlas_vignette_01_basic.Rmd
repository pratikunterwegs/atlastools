This vignette shows the basics of using atlastools. It is a work in progress.
atlastools has two main purposes: accessing and cleaning data, and identifying residence patches from the data.
Only the latter is covered here.

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(atlastools)
```

# Concept: Patches

Patches are identified as shown in the schematic. More to be added in time.

```{r show_patch_schematic, eval=TRUE,echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("../inst/schematic.png")
```

# Making patches

Begin by reading in the data.

```{r read_data}
# read data and see leading lines
library(data.table)
data <- fread("vignette_data/413_004_revisit.csv")

head(data)
```

Now make residence patches after inferring residence from gaps in the data.

```{r process_data}
# run the three main functions on the data
# first infer residence
temp_data <- atl_infer_residence(data = data,
                                 inf_patch_time_diff = 30,
                                 inf_patch_spat_diff = 100)

# classify residence points
temp_data <- atl_classify_points(data = temp_data,
                                 lim_res_time = 2)

# make residence patches with sensible parameters
patches <- atl_make_res_patch(data = temp_data,
                              buffer_radius = 10,
                              lim_spat_indep = 100,
                              lim_time_indep = 30,
                              lim_rest_indep = 30,
                              min_fixes = 3)
```

# Getting data from patches

Get and view the different kinds of patch data

## Patch summary

The patch summary is a data.table and has no complex (list, sf) column types.
The patches can be visualised using ggplot (or anything else).

```{r get_patch_summary}
# get patch summary
patch_summary <- atl_get_patch_summary(res_patch_data = patches,
                                       which_data = "summary")

# get the class of the full object and the column types
class(patch_summary)
```

## Patch points

The patch points are the raw points that make up the residence patches.

```{r get_patch_points}
# get patch points
patch_points <- atl_get_patch_summary(res_patch_data = patches,
                                      which_data = "points")

# get class and column type
class(patch_points)
```

## Patch polygons

This should have the added class `sf`, and the polygons column should have the type `sfc_MULTIPOLYGON`.

```{r get_patch_polygons}
# get patch points
patch_polygons <- atl_get_patch_summary(res_patch_data = patches,
                                      which_data = "spatial")

# get class and column type
class(patch_polygons)
```

## Plot data types

Look at patch points and summary. Polygons are constructed as `x` metre buffers around patch points, and are not covered here.
The code to make this plot is in the watlas_vignette.Rmd fine in the package's vignettes folder (the source for this document).

```{r see_patch_summary, echo=FALSE}
# plotting libraries
library(ggplot2)
library(patchwork)

# plot patch summary
fig_patch_summary <- ggplot(patch_summary, aes(x_mean, y_mean))+
  geom_path(col = "black", lty = 2, lwd = 0.2)+
  geom_point(aes(size = duration/60,
                 col = waterlevel_start),
             stroke = 2,
             shape = 21, fill = "black",
             alpha = 0.9)+
  geom_text(aes(label = patch), 
            col = "white", size = 2)+

  scale_colour_distiller(palette = "RdBu", direction = 1)+

  # annotation_scale(location = "br", width_hint = 0.1, text_cex = 1)+
  
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank())+
  
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, 
       col = "waterlevel (cm NAP)", size = "residence (mins)",
       title = "(b) Patch summary data")

# plot patch points
fig_patch_points <- ggplot(patch_points, aes(x, y))+
  geom_path(col = "black", lty = 2, lwd = 0.1)+
  geom_point(aes(col = as.factor(patch)),
             shape = 21, alpha = 0.5,
                      show.legend = F)+
  
  scale_x_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0.1)))+
  scale_y_continuous(expand = expansion(mult = c(0.1)))+
  scale_colour_manual(values = rep(c('red', 'blue'), 
                                   (length(unique(patch_points$patch))+1) /2))+
  coord_sf(crs = 32631)+
  # annotation_scale(location = "br", width_hint = 0.1, text_cex = 1)+
  
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank())+
  
  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL,
       title = "(a) Patch point data: tag 413, tidal cycle 04")
```

```{r show_all_figures, fig.height=6, fig.width=6, echo=FALSE}
library(patchwork)

fig_patch_points / fig_patch_summary
